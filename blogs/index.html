                <h2>Vector Embeddings for dummies</h2>
                <p>Vector Embeddings are a core concept when it comes to Generative AI and LLMs. If youre diving deep into anything related to Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning it is highly unlikely that you’ll not end up studying about vector embeddings.

Let us take a look at what vector embedding is. While keeping things as technical jargon free as possible. If you’re just starting with GenAI this is the place to start from.</p>

                    remove them when they're done. It might sound simple, but it covers a lot of ground in React, from
                    state management to persisting data with Local Storage...</p>
